# Real Time Bus Tracker
 
<strong>Description</strong>

This is a bus tracker that shows the location, in real-time, of busses traveling north or south along the MBTA's (Massachessetts Bay Transportation Authority) Route 1 which travels between Harvard and MIT's campuses. This app was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, an API Key for Google Maps and an open API from the MBTA.

<strong>How-to-Run</strong>

Read through the HTML webpage and add your google maps API key to where it says “ADD_API_KEY_HERE”.

<strong>Roadmap of future improvements</strong>

<ul>
 <li>Customizing styling on the map</li>
 <li>Creating a route line on the map</li>
 <li>Adding a timer to see when the map will update</li>
</ul>
